# Nodedge actions

In the following tutorials, we describe how to perform basic actions in Nodedge.
Please be aware that Nodedge is still under active development, so this list may not be comprehensive or up-to-date. 
We welcome your feedback and contributions to improve it.

## Create a new model

> 1. Open Nodedge by clicking on its icon in the home page
> 2. Open a new file by:
>    * clicking on `File` > `New` in the Menu bar, or
>    * clicking on the `New` button in the Tool bar, or
>    * using `CTRL+N` shortcut

## Import a model

> 1. Open Nodedge by clicking on its icon in the home page
> 2. Open the existing file by:
>    * clicking on `File` > `Open` in the Menu bar, or
>    * clicking on the `Open` button in the Tool bar, or
>    * using `CTRL+O` shortcut
> 3. In the file navigator window that opens, select the file to open

## Save a model

> * Click on `File` > `Save` in the Menu bar, or
> * Click on the `Save` button in the Tool bar, or
> * Use `CTRL+S` shortcut

## Add a node

> Nodes are arranged by category in the node libraries. 
> 1. Select the appropriate library by clicking on it in the *Node libraries* widget to the right of the scene
> 2. Find the required node
> 3. Drag-and-drop it to the scene
>
> Alternatively:
> 1. Right-click on the scene
> 2. Place your cursor on the appropriate library 
> 3. Click on the required node
>
> If needed, edit the node configuration (e.g., change title, value, etc.) and connect it to your model.

## Add an edge

> 1. Click on the output socket of a node
> 2. Then, click on the input socket of another node
>
> The two nodes will be connected by a graphic edge and their respective sockets will change style to let you know that they
> are now taken. There can be a single edge connected to one input socket. When trying to connect a second edge to the 
> an input socket which is already taken, the latter will connect to the new edge and automatically disconnect from the 
> previous one.

## Add a comment

> 1. Click on `Add comment` in the Tool bar. A comment will appear in your scene with some dummy text
> 2. Click on the comment and edit the text
> 3. Click outside the text to validate your comment

## Select multiple objects

> To select multiple objects (nodes and edges) in the scene, click on the scene and drag the cursor.
> All the objects within your selection will be selected.

## Copy, paste, and cut

> 1. Select the objects in the scene that you want to modify
> 2. Then:
>    * click on the `Copy`, `Paste`, or `Cut` button in the Tool bar, or
>    * use the `CTRL+C`, `CTRL+V`, or `CTRL+X` shortcuts

## Fit model to view

> To fit the current model to the view:
> * Click on the `Spacebar` key, or
> * Click on `View` > `Fit to view` in the Menu bar

## Generate script from model

> To generate a Python script from the open model:
> 1. Start the code generation by:
>    * clicking on `Coder` > `Generate code` in the Menu bar, or
>    * clicking on the `Generate code` button in the Tool bar
> 2. Select the folder where to save the script and type the name of the file to be saved
> 3. Click on the `Save` button

# Dats actions

## Open a dataset

> Dats can handle a variety of data file extensions: csv, txt, json, and tdms. We are planning to add support for hdf and rosbag, too.
> To open a data file in Dats:
> 1. Open Dats by clicking on its icon in the home page
> 2. Open a file by:
>    * clicking on `File` > `Open` in the Menu bar, or
>    * using `CTRL+O` shortcut
> 3. In the file navigator window that opens, select the file to open
> 
> The data file will appear in the *Data files* widget on the left side of the page. The variables contained in the data file will be listed in the
> *Variables* widget.

## Plot a variable

> 1. In the *Variables* widget, select the name of the variable you want to plot
> 2. To plot it:
>    * drag and drop the variable in the subplot area, or
>    * click on the `Plot` button at the bottom of the *Variables* widget
>
> You can also select and plot multiple variables at once. To do so, hold down the `CTRL` or `SHIFT` key to perform the 
> multiple section.

## Create a subplot

> A subplot is a graphical area where one or more curves can be plotted. It contains two distinct axes, the x-axis and y-axis, 
> which are shared by all the curves within the subplot.
> 
> * Right-click on the worksheet area, then click on `Add subplot`

## Create a worksheet

> A worksheet is a window that contains one or multiple subplots where you can plot variables. 
> To create a worksheet: 
> 
> * Click on `File` > `Create worksheet` in the Menu bar, or
> * Use `CTRL+T` shortcut

## Remove a worksheet
> * Click on `File` > `Remove worksheet` in the Menu bar, or
> * User `CTRL+W` shortcut

## Create a workbook

> A workbook is a collection of worksheets. Workbooks can be useful for organizing data plots into different 
> categories. You can create multiple workbooks as needed to effectively manage your plots.
> To create a workbook:
> 
> * Click on `File` > `Create workbook` in the Menu bar, or
> * Use `CTRL+SHIFT+T` shortcut

## Remove a workbook
> * Click on `File` > `Remove workworkbook` in the Menu bar, or
> * User `CTRL+SHIFT+W` shortcut

## Save Dats configuration

> Data can store the configuration of a work session, including workbooks, worksheets, and subplots layout, as well as 
> the formulas of any variables created. 
> This function is useful for freezing the current work session and allowing you to return to it at a later time. 
> It is also helpful for regularly working with data files that contain the same variables.
>
> 1. Click on `File` > `Save configuration` in the Menu bar
> 2. Select the folder where to save the configuration file and edit the file name
> 3. Click on `Save`. A JSON file will be saved in the selected folder

## Restore Dats configuration

> 1. Click on `File` > `Restore configuration` in the Menu bar
> 2. In the file selection window that opens, navigate to the file that you want to restore
> 3. Click on `Open`.

## Fit content to view

> This functionality allows you to fit all plotted curves into the view. To do so:
> 
> * Click on `View` > `Fit to view`, or
> * Press the `Spacebar` key
 
## Create new variable

> In Dats, variables may be native or derived from a user-provided formula. Native variables are those imported from a dataset and 
> they are denoted with a tilde (`~`) in the *Variables* widget, while variables derived from a formula are indicated with the letter `f`.
> 
> 1. Click on `Tools` > `Create variable` in the Menu bar
> 2. In the variable editor window that opens, edit the name and formula of the variable to be created. If the formula includes  
> existing variables, you can either manually type their name or double-click on them from the variable list on the left 
> to paste their name
> 3. Validate your formula by clicking on `Ok`

## Edit curve color

> 1. Right-click on the curve
> 2. Select the `Customize curve` action
> 3. In the color window, you can select a color from the palette or specify the hex value
> 4. Once you are done, click on `Ok`

## Delete a curve

> To delete a curve from a subplot:
> 1. Click on the curve to be deleted
> 2. Delete it by:
>    * clicking on `Tools` > `Delete curve`, or
>    * pressing the `Del` key
