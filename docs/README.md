# What is Nodedge?

<div>

Nodedge is the first free and open-source graphical editor for engineering applications.
It provides you with a comprehensive and intuitive environment for a variety of applications. 
With Nodedge you can:
* easily design and simulate dynamical systems, such as robotic, physical, and chemical systems;
* generate Python code from your diagram-like models with a simple click;
* interactively plot and edit the data generated by your simulation;
* effortlessly import, plot, and analyze logs in the most common file formats (like csv, mf4, mat, and others)

The user interface is designed for simplicity, allowing you to quickly sketch your program using a drag-and-drop interface with graphic blocks.
A set of built-in block libraries implements common functionalities like scalar and matrix operations, integration, differentions, and many others.
Besides, users can implement their own custom blocks, which can be reused and shared among the community.

Nodedge is written in Python, the number one programming language in the world for number of users. Its code is fully transparent and freely available 
on Github for community collaboration and contributions. This ensures that Nodedge is constantly evolving and improving based on the latest
needs of its users.

<h3>Physical simulation</h3>
The Nodedge simulation app allows you to simulate various types of systems and processes. 
These simulations can suit a variety of purposes, such as testing and analyzing the behavior of a physical model, 
predicting the outcomes of a chemical reaction, or studying the movements and actions of a robotic system.
To learn more about it, check out the examples [here](resources.md).

<h3>Data plotting and analysis</h3>
Nodedge plotting app is called Dats. Within Dats, you can easily import the data generated by your simulation, plot, and edit it.
You can create new variables, also called signals, by modifying the existing ones, filtering, and combining them.

<h3>Code generation</h3>
Currently, Nodedge supports the generation of standalone Python scripts from any graphical model.
However, Nodedge has the ambitious goal to support code generation for various microcontrollers. 
This means that users will be able to create their models graphically and then use Nodedge to convert those models into code that can be understood by microcontrollers and uploaded to the desired platform.

# Getting started

For getting started, you can download the installer to Nodedge [latest release](https://github.com/nodedge/nodedge/releases/download/v0.3/NodedgeSetup.exe).
Alternatively, you can install Nodedge form pip with:
```
pip install nodedge
```
If you wish to contribute, you can clone our project from [Github](https://github.com/nodedge/nodedge) and install the dev requirements with:
```
git clone https://github.com/nodedge/nodedge nodedge
cd nodedge
pip install -r .\requirements\freeze\requirements_dev.txt
```

For starting developing Nodedge, check out the [guidelines for contributors](https://github.com/nodedge/nodedge/wiki). 
In particular, we recommend using PyCharm IDE. You can find some helping information on the [PyCharm setup on Nodedge Wiki](https://github.com/nodedge/nodedge/wiki/Pycharm-setup) or [PyCharm website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

# Roadmap

Currently, Nodedge provides a graphical scripting environment with real-time evaluation.
However, Nodedge is undergoing a major development phase.
We are working hard to provide you with unique features:
* a versatile and customizable **plotting environment** for the analysis of time series;
* support of the most common data file format;
* a **simulation environment** for the simulation of physical models, chemical processes, robotic systems, and many others;
* support for robotics-specific features, such as **embedded code generation** for common hardware platform, real-time data acquisition and inspection.
