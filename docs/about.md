# Our mission
Nodedge's mission is to redefine the standards of scientific scripting and model-based design.
Nodedge is the first **free and open-source** graphic environment for scientists and engineers.
It is based on the **latest-generation technology** for a user experience that has never been so enjoyable.

# Our vision
Why should scientific knowledge be only for a few? By making Nodedge open source and free, we intend to
**democratize knowledge**, **incentivize collaboration**, and give everyone the tool they deserve to create the
**innovations of tomorrow**.
